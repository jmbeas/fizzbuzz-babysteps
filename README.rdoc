= fizzbuzz step by step

With this exercise I want to use FizzBuzz codekata
in order to explore which are the forces that we
have to take into account to guide our TDD. With 
that goal in mind I want to design FizzBuzz with
baby-steps and very focused on every refactor and
the reason why I'm doing it.

== NOTE

* The language used is Ruby

* The skeleton of this project was created using 
"jeweler"
